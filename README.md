A simple KivyMD app for taking short notes in a minimal, focused environment. Has basic save and read features.

The app is intentionally simple, and while some updates are to come, notably a better save system and certain quality-of-life additions (a basic clock, command confirmation, etc), it will remain largely the same

## V0.1, released only for Windows so far
